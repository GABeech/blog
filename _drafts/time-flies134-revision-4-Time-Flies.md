<p>Excuse me for a bit while I get a little sentimental. Tomorrow (the 27th of September) marks my two year anniversary with Stack Exchange - it was still called Stack Overflow Internet Services when I joined! I realized this about two or three weeks ago when I was setting up my trip to Denver for the <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2012/09/join-us-for-our-opening-reception-of-stack-exchange-denver/">Opening Party</a>. It just amazes me how quickly time flies when you are having fun.</p>

<p>It's amazing to me how much the company has grown, how much has been accomplished, and the <a href="http://stackexchange.com/about/team">amazing people</a> I've met while working here. It's a little bit awe inspiring to look back at the day I started and what the company looked like vs where we are at now.</p>

<p>On my first day the space at 55 Broadway hadn't been renovated yet, they had done some demo, but that was about it. It was a puke green color, and there was a lot of work that needed to be done. I think there where 10 people in the office when I started. We lived in one half of the office, while they worked in the other have building things then we would move it was just a mess of wires strewn across the floor and a bunch of desks clumped together (along with some lucky people that got to share the few offices!)</p>

<p>Now, we are rapidly running out of room at 55 Broadway and have opened an office in Denver, with other great plans to expand and grow.</p>

<p>As far as the sites, we've gone from around the 300 mark to flirting with breaking the top 100 on Quantcast since I've been here. There have been many fun challenges, and lots of hard work to get us to where we are today.</p>

<p>As I site here at 10,000 ft. writing this all I can think of is how this is exactly what I envisioned all these years ago when I decided at least once in my life I wanted to work for a start up. How awesome it is to have a dream come true, and have it be exactly what you thought it would be.</p>
