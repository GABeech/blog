<p>Many people hold the idea that all Systems Administrators are BOFH's. That is, arrogant, anti-social blow-hards that don't ever want to help you and seem to take joy in your pain. There are some out there that give us a bad name, but for the most part Systems Administrators are great people. I think that a lot of these misconceptions that people have in their heads about the general attitude of a sysadmin is due to an imperfect understanding of our job, and what really goes into what we do.</p>

<p>We really have multiple job duties and responsibilities that we need to have as part of our skills arsenal to be really good. And, honestly not all of them are as fun as building out an infrastructure - or in other words solving fun technical problems. Some of these things really, really suck and of course are the parts of our job that people identify most with, and remember.</p>

<p>Because we all like lists - here are a few areas that the sysadmins have to know about, or at least be aware of while working:</p>

<ul>
<li>Network Configuration</li>
<li>Systems Configuration</li>
<li>Application Configuration</li>
<li>Application Design</li>
<li>Security</li>
<li>Risk-Management</li>
<li>Finance (we spend a LOT of money) </li>
<li>Corporate Policy (and I'm not talking about just signing off we need to actually <em>know</em> a lot of this stuff) </li>
<li>Facilities Operation</li>
<li>Electrical Design Principals</li>
</ul>

<p>There is a good deal of stuff there, and honestly I probably could have kept going but I didn't want this post to get too long. Before I get too far into describing some of these things I'd like to say 1) I'm not making excuses for the behavior of some in our profession and 2) Depending on where you work this list could be longer or shorter but at some point in your career you'll interact with some or all of these items.</p>
