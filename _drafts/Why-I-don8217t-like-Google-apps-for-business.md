I know in the IT world this is blasphemy, but I don't like Google apps for business at all. I've never been a fan of outsourcing something as critical to business these days as email. It just doesn't make a whole lot of sense.  But, when I started at <a href="http://stackexchange.com">Stack Exchange, Inc.</a> that is what they used for their email system. Being the admin I am, i sat down bit my tongue and dove into learning how to admin and properly run google apps for business. 

My first attempt to use google apps was to use the web interface, since I knew that very well heck I use gmail for my personal email. The first thing that I notice ... it ... is ... god awefully slow. Painfully slow. When you are trying to get things done and have to site there for 10-20 seconds between page loads, that A) ruins your train of thought and consequently, ruins your productivity. 
<br />
The next issue I have with the interface is that it does not lend its self to multi tasking. The major obstacle I run into all the time is the fact that I run with three or four browser windows open with upwards of twenty to thirty tabs in each at any given point in time. When I have to bounce out of an email i'm writing to fix an issue i can take me a good 5-10 mins to find that email I was writing again. Yes, this can be an issue with a normal mail client + server, but it's mitigated by the fact you can jump to the mail client program group and have much less diversity in what you are looking for.
